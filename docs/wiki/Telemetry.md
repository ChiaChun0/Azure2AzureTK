# Telemetry Tracking Using Customer Usage Attribution (PID)
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

We are not currently tracking any telemetry in the Azure to Azure migration toolkit. However, we are considering using Customer Usage Attribution (PID) for telemetry tracking in the future. This will help us understand how users interact with the toolkit and improve its functionality based on user feedback.

If you have any questions or concerns about telemetry tracking, please feel free to reach out to us. We value your privacy and will ensure that any telemetry data collected is used responsibly and in accordance with our privacy policy.
